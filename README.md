This is my first ever Django web application project! 
Following along with Python Crash Course 3ed, and making some personalized edits, I have created a learning log web app which helps users track their 
learning. Users can create accounts and input data (notes) on whichever subject they are learning. This app simplifies
the note-taking process for students or self-interested learners through a simple framework, making tracking easy!
